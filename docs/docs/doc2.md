It is necessary to have R installed in order to be able to run this code. R is a
free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles
and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. To
[download R.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), please choose your
preferred [CRAN mirror.](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)

There are four main script files within the
[**code on Github**](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Robyn/tree/master/source):

1. **_fb\_*robyn_mmm*(...)func.R:_** Where all the model functions are stored.
2. **_fb\_*robyn_mmm*(...)exec.R:_** Where the functions above are executed.
   This will be the main script you will be working with.
3. **_fb\_*robyn_mmm*(...)plot.R:_** Where the functions to plot results are
   kept.
4. **_fb\_*robyn_mmm*(...)optm.R:_** Where the optimiser functions reside.

Please **download** and **open** all of them in your R environment.
